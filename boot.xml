	savedir

	Set this to [DEFAULT] for the default save directory.
		Windows: C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\3909\PapersPlease\
		OSX: ~/Library/Application Support/PapersPlease/

	Set to the full path of a custom directory to change where saves are stored.
		ie (Windows): D:\Games\Saves\PapersPlease
		ie (OSX): /Users/[USERNAME]/Documents/PapersPleaseSaves
		(The directory will be created if it doesn't exit.)

	savebackups

	Set this to "true" to save a copy of all files to the "backups" subdirectory
	of the save dir.
	-->
	<savebackups>false</savebackups>

	<!--
	softwarerendering

	Set this to "true" to force the game to run with software rendering. This mode
	is more likely to work if your video card has trouble with OpenGL, but it may
	prevent the Steam overlay from appearing. Software rendering is visually
	identical to hardware rendering, just a little slower. A snail icon will 
	appear on the settings screen when software rendering is active.

	Software rendering can also be enabled by adding "softren" as a command line
	parameter when starting the game.

	<!-- 
	resizeFullscreen
	
	Set this to "true" to force the fullscreen video mode to best match the game's
	native 570x320 resolution. This may lead to a slightly blurry appearance, but
	can scale better on some low-resolution monitors.

	If this is "false", the monitor's native resolution will be used to provide
	the sharpest visuals.
